# This project is no longer maintained

It's been many years since writing this library. And I don't have time to dedicate to maintain it. On the up side, [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js) has really stepped up and taken the spotlight of javascript physics. It has everything PhysicsJS has and more. :)

# PhysicsJS

A modular, extendable, and easy-to-use physics engine for javascript.

Latest version: 0.7.0 (beta)

## Usage

**Please [visit the website](http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/) for
details about installation and usage**.

Distribution files are in the `dist/` directory.

## Contributing

Source code is kept in the `src/` directory. After any source code
modifications it will be necessary to run the grunt build task to
rebuild the source and run unit tests.

First install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Next install dev dependencies:

    $ npm install

then run grunt

    $ grunt

The default grunt task will create a `_working/` directory with the
PhysicsJS development build. You can play around with that.
**NOTE**: the `_working/` directory won't be committed
(it is in .gitignore).

After you run this you can use (Mr.doob's) htmleditor in `editor/` to play around.

If you want grunt to automatically create the development build
when you modify the source in `src/` then run:

    $ grunt watch

**Note** grunt watch won't run unit tests.

### Pull Requests

If you are contributing a bug-fix or a very minor addition, feel free to
do a pull request on the master branch.

If it is something else create a new (or existing) feature branch (eg: `feature/MY_FEAT`)
and issue a pull request on that.

If unsure, create an issue to discuss.

Please ensure that:

* the files in `dist/` are _unmodified_.
* the features you add are well documented with jsdoc comments if applicable.
* the code is indented with 4 space characters.
